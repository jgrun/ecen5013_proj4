 * int32_t uart_init(void)
 *	Description: Configures UART0 for 57600 BR, 8-N-1 UART comm.
 *	INTERRUPT switch being set initializes UART TX and RX buffers
 *	and enables RX interrupts.
 *	Parameters:
 *		- none
 *	Possible Return Values:
 *		- UART_INIT_SUCCESS: UART succesfully initialized
 *		- UART_INIT_FAILURE: when INTERRUTPS switch set,
 *			occurs if Buffer for UART are unable to be created

 *	Possible Return Values:
 *		- UART_SEND_SUCCESS: data successfully sent
 *		- UART_SEND_FAILURE: data is NULL, no data sent
 *		- UART_SEND_BUFADD_SUCCESS: when INTERRUPTS switch is set,
 *			indicates that data has been buffered.

 *	in the TXBuf.
 *	Parameters:
 *		- uint8_t* data: pointer to data being sent
 *		- uint32_t length: number of bytes pointed at by data
